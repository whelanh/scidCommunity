**scidCommunity** is a powerful chess analysis and database program. Originally derived from `Scid` (Shane's Chess Information Database), it has evolved into a distinct tool with numerous enhancements and a growing community of over 3,400 users around the world.

While it maintains compatibility with the original Scid database formats, **scidCommunity** focuses on modern features like integrations with Lichess and Chess.com, user-requested improvements, and a streamlined experience for analysis and database management. **scidCommunity** is free software and is released under the GPL licence.

### Key Enhancements & Features

6. Based on a [user request](https://github.com/whelanh/scidCommunity/discussions/176), it is now possible to open an arbitrarily large number of **Analysis Windows** by double clicking the engines in the **Configure Engines** or **Analysis Window..** pop up dialogs.
7. Daily chess puzzle and more puzzles from Lichess with the new [**Lichess Puzzles**](https://github.com/whelanh/scidCommunity/discussions/167) feature under the **Play** menu.
8. New [engine vs. engine tournament feature](https://github.com/whelanh/scidCommunity/discussions/162) and [PGN Viewer](https://github.com/whelanh/scidCommunity/discussions/161) adopted from [Uwe Klimmek](https://codeberg.org/scid/scid) 
9. Thanks to a [user suggestion](https://github.com/whelanh/scidCommunity/discussions/123), a new **Lichess OpenExplorer** button has been added to the **PGN Window** that provides access to the Lichess Opening Explorer data from the Masters, Lichess, and Player databases.
10. For games with `[%clk ]` time comments, a new **Tools/Time Analysis** [feature](https://github.com/whelanh/scidCommunity/discussions/59) charts clock time remaining and time used per move.
9. Lichess-based calculation of White and Black's "Game Accuracy" [included](https://github.com/whelanh/scidCommunity/discussions/49) in the upper left of the engine score graph in the **Engine Window**.
10. Thanks to a well thought out and detailed [user proposal](https://github.com/whelanh/scidCommunity/discussions/32), developers can now access Scid databases directly in their code using scidCommunity's new headless API.  More documentation can be found in the /docs folder.
8. Users can now see up to 4 half-move sequences in the **Tree Window**   The user's preferred Tree Window move depth can be saved under **Options/Preferences/Moves**

25. The **Engine** windows have been enhanced:
      - New depth and move time input windows for limiting an engine's calculations. If users choose to use Scid's **Save Options**, the inputs will be saved as the defaults for future use.
      - Thanks to a [user suggestion](https://github.com/whelanh/scidCommunity/discussions/38), the Engine Window upper panel now pre-populates with stored evaluations from Lichess if they are available and it caches local engine results if they get to a deeper level than the pre-populated PVs.
      - New *Auto Comment* button attempts to inject a meaningful comment for the current move from AI, while *Game Comment* button will provide comments for moves that have annotations and a game summary.

## 💽 Releases
Check latest **[Releases](https://github.com/whelanh/scidCommunity/releases)** for a deb, rpm, a Windows exe, a MacOS and AppImage installable package.  The deb has been tested against Ubuntu 24, the rpm against Fedora Rawhide, the AppImage against Fedora Kinoite (Rawhide) and the exe file against a Windows 11 virtual machine. The Mac version appears to be blocked by Apple's security protocols.  However if you build it yourself on a Mac (see below), you can run it by invoking it from the terminal. 

Linux users can install scidCommunity from [Flathub](https://flathub.org/en/apps/io.github.whelanh.scidCommunity), however the Flathub update process is slower. The Flatpak is installed with limited access to your file system.  You will probably want to grant it access to your home directories for storing preferences and accessing your stored database.  You can do that with the **Flatseal** flatpak, or with the terminal command `flatpak override --user io.github.whelanh.scidCommunity --filesystem=home` or `flatpak override --user io.github.whelanh.scidcommunity --filesystem=/path/to/directory`

For the most recent developments, see the **[Releases](https://github.com/whelanh/scidCommunity/releases)** section or:
* For rpm based Linux systems, ScidCommunity is also available through the [Fedora Copr Repo](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/whelanh/scidcommunity/)
* For Arch-based systems, it is available on the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/scidcommunity) 
* **scidCommunity** is also available from the [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/scidcommunity).  See the section below if you are an Ubuntu or Kubuntu user.

**Windows Users** are advised to use the "setup.exe" in the **Releases** section.  You may need to use a browser other than Edge (e.g., Chrome or Firefox) to succesfully download the .exe file.

**Ubuntu/Kubuntu Users**  If you try and install the .deb pacakage from **Releases** using the Kubuntu App Center (Discover) or Ubuntu App Center, recent Ubuntu/Kubuntu versions frequently intercepts local .deb files, searches its store, and installs the sandboxed Snap version instead.  The Snap version is sandboxed with limited permissions.  scidCommunity's file chooser in the Snap version, for example, can't see your home directory unless you run `sudo snap connect scidcommunity:home` in a terminal. To actually install the .deb file from **Releases**, open a terminal and run `sudo snap remove scidcommunity --purge` (if you used the App Center before) and then run `sudo apt install ./scidcommunity-5.1.3.97-Linux.deb` (using the correct version number) from the directory where you downloaded the .deb file (most likely `~/Downloads`). 

## Building from Source

### macOS
```bash
git clone https://github.com/whelanh/scidCommunity.git
cd scidCommunity
./build_app.sh
make install
```

The `ScidCommunity.app` bundle contains the app and can be moved to `/Applications`. You can also create a symbolic link to the executable `ScidCommunity.app/Contents/scid/scid`.  However Apple security protocols may make this difficult.  You can build it from source using the commands listed above and then invoke it from the scidCommunity folder using the terminal command `./scidCommunity`   You may need to run `./build_app.sh` several times for Apple to download the needed tcl/tk libraries.

### Linux
Requires: `tcl8.6-dev`, `tk8.6-dev` (or equivalent for your distribution). It will now compile against tk and tcl 9.0 libraries (e.g. Fedora Rawhide `tcl-devel` and `tk-devel`).

**Sound Support**: scidCommunity uses a multi-backend audio system that attempts to find the best available player on your system.
- **Linux**: Works with `pw-play` (PipeWire), `paplay` (PulseAudio), `aplay` (ALSA), or the `tcl-snack` package.
- **Windows**: Uses `powershell` or the included `scidsnd.exe`.
- **macOS**: Uses `afplay`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/whelanh/scidCommunity.git
cd scidCommunity
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

#### CMake Build
```sh
git clone https://github.com/whelanh/scidCommunity.git
cd scidCommunity
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```
